The word diversity means the condition of having or being composed of differing elements,
especially the inclusion of different types of people (such as people of different races or
cultures) in a group or organization. Diversity has been studied extensively in a range of contexts,
such as social science and biological science. It is an aspect of quality of a collection of items
instead of individual items. In technical context, diversity represents a means for "hedging bets",
ensuring that different kinds of objects are represented in the output of an algorithm.
For example, a search engine application may return a collection of diverse results rather than very similar ones,
thus increasing the likelihood that a user's information need is properly addressed even in cases when it was stated
ambiguously. Diversity has been studied technically in machine learning, information retrieval and data management
communities: focusing on diversity in the input, focusing on diversity in search results and focusing on diversity in query results.

Diversity is desired in many contexts, ranging from results of
a Web search to admissions at a university. As algorithms are
increasingly used to make decisions, there is growing interest in
algorithms that can produce diverse results. Indeed, fairness and
diversity are central to responsible data science practice.

Diversity is a set concept: it makes no sense to talk about
an individual item as being diverse. Fairness is less clearly a
set concept; nevertheless, fairness is often stated with respect
to some comparison standard, usually a group. For
example, in the context of racial discrimination, we frequently
refer to under-represented minorities, which is a set construct,
with fairness requiring proportional representation.

Most algorithmic decision-making is based on the individual:
typically, a score is assigned to an individual item based on its
attributes. However, since fairness and diversity are set concepts,
they can only be guaranteed as part of a set selection procedure.
