Algorithmic decisions often result in scoring and ranking individuals
to determine credit worthiness, qualications for college
admissions and employment, and compatibility as dating partners.
While automatic and seemingly objective, ranking algorithms (or
rankers) can discriminate against individuals and protected groups
and exhibit low diversity. Furthermore, ranked results are often
unstable‚Äîsmall changes in the input data or in the ranking methodology
may lead to drastic changes in the output, making the result
uninformative and easy to manipulate. Similar concerns apply in
cases where items other than individuals are ranked, including
colleges, academic departments, or products.

Ranking Facts, a Web-based application that generates a ‚Äúnutritional label‚Äù for rankings.
Ranking Facts is made up of a collection of visual widgets that implement
our latest research results on fairness, stability, and transparency for
rankings, and that communicate details of the ranking methodology
or of the output to the end user.
