I'm a third-year PhD candidate in [Computer Science](http://drexel.edu/cci/departments/computer-science/) at
[Drexel University](drexel.edu).
My research focuses on responsible data management and non-discriminatory machine learning.

<br/>

I'm a member of [Drexel Database Group](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/dbgroup/) and my advisor is Prof. [Julia Stoyanovich](https://www.cs.drexel.edu/~julia/).

<br/>

I'm currently working on interpreting fairness in ranking-related applications with the goal to mitigate the effect of discrimination toward sub-groups (externally protected by national laws).
